        <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded notfor-profit
            educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and
            Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
            fields like</p>

            <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open source
                technologies like, <strong>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React
                    Native</strong>
                while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
                techniques on cloud platforms like AWS</p>

        <div id="ai">
            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of
                the AI
                technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <strong> <em>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
                        Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</em></strong> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use
                cases, and
                ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice</p>
        </div>
        <div id="bcn">
            <h2>blockChain</h2>
            <p>The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like
                <strong><em>Ethereum
                        and Hyperledger (Fabric),</em></strong> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity,
                JavaScript on
                frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
                (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-aservice (BaaS)
                and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>

        <div id="iot">
            <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
            <p>The Internet of things program introduces the students to open source development
                technologies like Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
                and Kubernetes while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT
                Cloud, and voice computing for device control</p>
