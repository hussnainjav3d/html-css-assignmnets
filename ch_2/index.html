    <h1>JS Documnetation</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><em>JavaScript is a cross-platform</em>, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
        language.
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
        environment to provide programmatic control over them</p>

    <h2>What you should already know</h2>
    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:<br> A general understanding of the Internet and the
        <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>. <br>Good working knowledge of <abbr
            title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page
        about JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p><s>JavaScript And Java Are same</s><dfn> JavaScript and Java</dfn> are similar in some ways but fundamentally
        different in some others. The
        JavaScript language
        resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java
        expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
        from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system
        based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
        prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
        provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
        supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
        executing as loosely typed methods.
        <br>
        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
        methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
        have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

    <h2>Some Examples</h2>
    <h4>Hello World</h4>
    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
        code:<br>

        <q>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br>

            greetMe("World");</q> <br>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
        conform to certain rules.<br>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore<sup> _ </sup>,
        or
        dollar
        sign
        <sub>$</sub> subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters
        include the
        characters <q>A</q> through <q>Z</q> (uppercase) and the characters <q>a</q> through <q>z</q> (lowercase).
        <br>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
        sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Declaring variables</h3>
    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
        With the keyword var. For example,<br>

        <q>var x = 42</q>
        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        By simply assigning it a value. For example, <br>

        <q>x = 42</q>
        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
        variant. With the keyword let. For example, <br>

        <q><del>var x = 13</del> <ins>let y = 13</ins></q> <br>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
