    <h1>JS Documnetation</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><em>JavaScript is a cross-platform</em>, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
        language.
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
        environment to provide programmatic control over them</p>
